      <p>
       <p>
  I’m <strong>Arshiya</strong>, a <strong>full-stack developer and designer</strong> currently studying at <strong>UT Dallas</strong>, where I earned a <strong>4.0 GPA in my very first semester</strong> after transferring to the University of Texas at Dallas. I work across <strong>frontend and backend systems</strong> and have built and presented multiple <strong>IoT projects</strong> including <strong>SeeSense Stop</strong> and <strong>Finding Nemo</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>SeeSense Stop</strong> is an <strong>IoT and OpenCV based security system</strong> that detects people entering restricted areas and alerts authorities in real time. 
  <strong>Finding Nemo</strong> is an <strong>IoT based patient tracking system</strong> designed to help monitor and locate patients within healthcare environments.
</p>
<p>
  I have experience with technologies including <strong>JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, and Arduino</strong>, and have built projects ranging from <strong>web applications to embedded systems</strong>. 
  I am passionate about creating <strong>user-friendly and efficient solutions</strong> that leverage technology to solve real-world problems.
<p>
  I also won <strong>2nd place at Sterlo’s Ideathon</strong> for building a <strong>music application</strong> using their <strong>low-code no-code platform</strong>, demonstrating my ability to <strong>rapidly prototype</strong>. 
  At UT Dallas, I have participated in events such as the <strong>Verizon Hackathon</strong>, collaborating on real-world technical challenges.
</p>

<p>
  Alongside this, I am actively <strong>learning AI and machine learning</strong> and building projects in these areas to deepen my understanding of <strong>intelligent systems</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond technology, I am a <strong>state champion in 10m air rifle shooting</strong> and have won <strong>multiple gold medals</strong>, reflecting strong <strong>discipline, focus, and multi-tasking</strong>.
